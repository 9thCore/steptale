A repository where I keep StepTale.

You can make a chart without lua, but lua helps bring it to life by making sprites that move etc.

### !! USING LUA FOR A CHART ASSUMES THAT YOU HAVE BASIC LUA KNOWLEDGE !!

New versions will go into Releases (right tab).
(there is currently no release yet, still working on it)

Any problems/bugs should be posted in Issues.

The wiki should help you with getting started.

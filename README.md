# steptale
A repository where I keep StepTale.

StepTale is a sort-of recreation of StepMania. Arrow go on other arrow, you press arrow to hit. It's that simple!

I started this as a challenge a year or two earlier but I didn't have nearly enough experience to bring it to life. However, now I did and made this.

You can make a chart without lua, but lua helps bring it to life by making sprites that move etc.

### !! USING LUA FOR A CHART ASSUMES THAT YOU HAVE BASIC LUA KNOWLEDGE !!

New versions will be posted in the GameJolt page (becaue I'm sure I'll forget to update this heh)

Any problems/bugs should be posted in Issues.

The wiki should help you with getting started.
